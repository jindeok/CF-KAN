# CF-KAN

## KAN (Kolmogorov-Arnold Network)-based Collaborative Filtering (CF)

![그림1](https://github.com/jindeok/CF-KAN/assets/35905280/a9b4ca1d-07e4-497b-9ec1-57454475f431)

**CF-KAN** is a **recommendation system (collaborative filtering) based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN, https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19756) approach**. This project leverages and explores the power of KAN for CF-based recommendation.

(For KAN implementation, I've refered to this repo: https://github.com/Blealtan/efficient-kan)

## Running

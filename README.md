**CF-KAN** is a **recommendation system (collaborative filtering) based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN, https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19756) approach**. This project leverages and explores the power of KAN for CF-based recommendation.



## Running 
To get started with CF-KAN, clone the repository and install the required dependencies (pytorch and numpy, etc)

If you are ready, test it with

`python main.py`
